## Quick Math

This project is my final capstone project to receive my Associate's Degree. I wanted to do a project in which I would be interested. 
After asking everyone I knew for ideas, I decided to make a game to help my mom's elementary school students learn math.

The premise of the game is that the students can log into the game and try to solve as many math problems as possible. 

The main thing I want to accomplish with this project is to learn how to connect a Javascript web app to a backend language (Java) and a database management system (MySQL)



Features:
Users will be able to make their own accounts and those accounts will store their top 3 scores.
Users will also be able to send friend requests to any of their friends who have an account, which will allow them to see the top 3 times of each of their friends.
Users will be able to access a leaderboard of the top 20 fastest playtimes in the system.
