# Quick Math

## Description
This project is my final capstone project to receive my Associate's Degree. I wanted to do a project in which I would be interested. 
After asking everyone I knew for ideas, I decided to make a game to help my mom's elementary school students learn math.
The premise of the game is that the students can log into the game and try to solve as many math problems as possible. 
The main thing I want to accomplish with this project is to learn how to make a full-stack project with a JavaScript front end,
Java backend, and a database attached

## Technologies Used in this project:
    Spring boot (backend)
    MySql Server (database)



## Features:
    Users will be able to make their own accounts and those accounts will store their top score.
    Users will be able to log in and out of their accounts
    Users will also be able to view their own gameplay statistics on their account page, and look up other users
    Users will be able to access a leaderboard of the top 10 highest scores.

## To Run:
    To run this application, first you must run the MySQL script to build the MySQL database. Once that is built and configured, the 
    Java application needs to be built using maven. Once it is built and run, it will load onto localhost:8080 - if the port is not already occupied.
    If port 8080 is occupied, the port chosen instead will be listed in the console logs.
